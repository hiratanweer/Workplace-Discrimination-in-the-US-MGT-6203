# Workplace-Discrimination-in-the-US-MGT-6203

# Description
In order to understand workplace discrimination in corporate America today, we analyzed 13 years of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)â€™s Charge Receipts by State data. To do a contextual analysis of the number of complaints filed in each state, we combined state population data from the US Census Bureau to get the number of charges received by EEOC per 100,000 people.

To understand how demographics of a region impact the total number of workplace discrimination complaints filed, we combined Bridged-Race Postcensal Population Estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to our existing data. We also incorporated party affiliation information of the state governor for each year from the National Governors Association. We then built a linear regression model using this dataset to get a high-level view of any possible dependencies of the number of complaints filed with the EEOC on state demographics, leading party affiliations and state population makeup.
